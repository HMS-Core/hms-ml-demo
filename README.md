|-- [ApplicationCases](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo/tree/master/ApplicationCases) // Application cases developed based on ML Kit.


## Precautions

The hms-ml-demo project contains two independent projects. After downloading the code, you can load different nested projects to the IDE as required. And you can run each project independently.

#### Create a Project

The root folder already contains a common build.gradle file, which loads the latest Android Gradle plugins, AGConnect, and Kotlin to classpath. Therefore, if you create a project, delete the build.gradle file in the root directory of the project, unless a unique Gradle plugin is needed. The same applies to gradle.properties.

All projects and nested modules are defined in the root directory of settings.gradle file. You can create a project, add all module entries of the project to the external settings.gradle file, and delete the settings.gradle file in the new project.
