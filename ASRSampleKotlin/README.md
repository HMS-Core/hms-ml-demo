## More Scenarios
The real-time speech recognition function provided by HUAWEI ML Kit is also applicable to the following scenarios:
1. Speech input via mobile phone apps
Convert speech into text in real time. It is applicable to various scenarios such as the voice chat, voice input, voice search, voice order placement, and voice command.
2. Real-time automatic speech recognition (RASR)
Audios such as meeting records, notes, and summaries can be converted into text in real time for content recording and real-time display.

## Getting Started
 - Clone the code library to the local computer.
