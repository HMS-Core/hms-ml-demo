## Introduction
Homework-Reader uses the text recognition and TTS functions of HUAWEI ML Kit to get the text in photos and convert it into audio output. Currently, the following languages are supported: simplified Chinese and English for TTS.

This demo demonstrates how to use [HUAWEI ML Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms/huawei-mlkit) to quickly implement the image reading function in your app. The purpose is to help you experience the text recognition and TTS functions and integrate HUAWEI ML Kit as soon as possible.


## More Scenarios
Huawei's text recognition and translation services can help you implement more interesting and powerful functions, such as:
- General text recognition
  - Recognition of text in bus license plates
  - Recognition of text in documents

- TTS
  - Novel reading
  - Navigation voice


## Procedure
 - Clone the code library to the local computer.

       git clone https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-ml-demo.git

 - If you have not registered as a developer, [register and create an app in AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/start/10115).
 - Obtain the agconnect-services.json file from [Huawei Developers](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Guides/ml-add-agc).
 - Replace the sample-agconnect-services.json file in the project.
 - Compile and run on an Android device or simulator.


## Supported Environment
Android 4.4 or later is recommended.
