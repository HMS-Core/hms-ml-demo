## Introduction
Photo-Translate uses the text recognition and translation functions of HUAWEI ML Kit to translate the text in static photos into the required language. Currently, the following languages are supported: simplified Chinese, English, French, Arabic, Thai, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Japanese, German, Italian, and Russian.

This demo demonstrates how to use [HUAWEI ML Kit] (https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/hms/huawei-mlkit) to quickly implement the image translation function in your app. The purpose is to help you experience the text recognition and translation functions and integrate HUAWEI ML Kit as soon as possible.

## More Scenarios
- Huawei's text recognition and translation services can help you implement more interesting and powerful functions, such as:
  - General text recognition
  - Recognition of text in bus license plates
  - Recognition of text in documents
